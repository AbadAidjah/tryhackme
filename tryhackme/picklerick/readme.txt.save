"we found login in http://10.10.31.155/login , username found in source code of first index page , passwd found in the src of the robot.txt page so they worked "


///// first ingrediant ////
we used the cmnd less with the name of the file in the command line so that it works "less Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt"
 which gave us the first ingrediant whcih is" mr. meeseek hair" 

we can also use pattern like "grep . fromfile " or we can use shell "while read line;do echo $line;done < filename"

we can use "grep -R ." this will work recursivley and shows us all what is in the files
